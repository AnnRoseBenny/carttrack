# Cart-Track : For a faster shopping experience

### Problem Statement:

One of the problems during shopping is that sometimes we may not get the complete idea of the
product. To get a better understanding about the product, customers may have to ask the
employees. Still we canâ€™t ensure the exact details from employees also. For huge shopping, it's
quite difficult to manually track the budget. If it's crowded, customers may need to wait in a
queue for a long time to make the payment. Keeping a paper bill for the future is also not a good
option. So collectively, customers lose some of their precious time shopping.

### Solution:

Our aim is to create an application that helps in budget tracking and easy payments while
shopping. The product can be added to cart by scanning the QR code on the product. Details of
the product will be available on scanning the QR code. The application automatically computes
the cost of the products in the cart. Scanned details can be used to create an invoice. Adding
and removing items from cart options can easily edit the invoice also. The invoice is directly
saved to the device. It can be of great use to customers as well as the shop owners. Need for
manual labour can be reduced. Direct payment can be made from the app. This can also reduce
the hustle and bustle in the billing area which has to be avoided especially during this pandemic.



### Who are benefitted:
